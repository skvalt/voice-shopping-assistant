The Voice Shopping Assistant is a complete stack, mobile-first application which grants us the facility to manage the shopping lists via a natural and local language voice commands. It is built on the concepts of Spring boot and MongoDB and provides JWT-authentication along with Rest Folks, creating items, updating, and removing them, categorizing, and retrieving items, and endpoints dedicated to voice-command processing, making sense of the intent, isolating items, processing quantities and normalizing multilingual queries, i.e. the processing of Hindi keywords. It also has a product-suggestion tool that gives substitutes, price-based suggestions, and contextual suggestions and CORS is set to React and has layer-structured structures to manage NLP logic, item workflows, and data storage.
The Frontend is a Vite single-page app using React and built with the TailwindCSS, Live speech-to-text chat integration with the Web Speech API, Authentication and signature workflows powered by JWT, real-time item management in a list (responsive linking), suggestive panels, search and filter (operated by Tailing interactions), categorizing items into groups, and resilient mobile vibe support through React Context as the state management platform.
Upon completion, this system will become a smart, voice-activated shopping assistant capable of understanding natural speech, automatic actions, handling secure and user-specific lists and making individual suggestions that are shown via a user-friendly and clean style of interface.
